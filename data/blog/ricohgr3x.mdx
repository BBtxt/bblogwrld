### The Ricoh GR

I don't know how to begin. This little tank of a camera has always made a cameo in my life and I think its here to stay. I guess since you're here I can give you a bit of back story on my times with this little camera. The first one I got was the Ricoh GR `first APSC model` back in college. I was moving away from film since I was going to live on a ships and didn't have a clear time line of when I'd be able to develope or buy more film. Sadly I sold after owning it for a couple month because I was a broke college student. After college I bought the Ricoh GR 2! It was great took it with me while i traveled the world via ship. After a while, the little camera began to collect dust as the Leica m10 be came my main camera. I shortly gave the Ricoh to my best friend as he wanted to get back into digital cameras.

Fast foward, I'm in a weird place in life were I'm making way more money than I've ever had in my life and yet I'm working 3000+ hours a year on a crane project. I'm just buying things to make me feel better about living to work. I have a Leica m10, Leica M10 Monochrome, and couple of Summicron lenses. One, would think wow you have it all but the lovely Youtube algorythm doesn't seem to think so. What pops up on my feed THE RICOH GR 3 `X`. The first Ricoh with a 40mm focal length... I need it. After 10 youtube reviews, its already in the mail.

This is were thing get weird for me. I now have three camera bodies, 5 lenses, and no time. I held on to my gear like it was a relection of who I was. I was my trophy for putting in all this hard work but I wasn't happy. I thought it was the gear. I finally lost it and sold everything but the one Leica and one lens. Life was good and simple. Black and white, 35mm lens.. Easy street.
