## YO! We back!

Man this place looks so much better! You might be asking youself "What happened to the old UI?" I personally didn't hate it but I also didn't like it either. The main reason for the switch was I HATED using the CMS. It was way to clunky and really not fun to use. I wanted something that wwas intrusive to us use and kept my work flow nice and easy.

## What's new?

So this site is using the same frontend pilars I've came to know and love which are [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and ya boy got freaky with some Typescript too. It's been a bit of a learning curve but these boys had the answers:

- [Totaly Typescript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript)
- [Pretty Typescript Errors](https://github.com/yoavbls/pretty-ts-errors)

We also using mdx for the blog posts now. If you don't know what that is, it's basically markdown but with the ability to use React components. So basically its Turbo time
